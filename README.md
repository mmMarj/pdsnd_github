Bikeshare project

### Description
This project is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree Programming for Data Science.
It offers to analyze data from a bike rental service and display predefined statistics. The program first asks to select a city (Chicago, New York and Washington), then offers to filter the data by month and/or by a day of the week. It is also possible to see some example of raw data.
